# How to Start Playing Games

## Step 1: Choose One Game

Pick one game with an active player base and clear learning resources.  
Avoid switching games in the first 30 days.

## Step 2: Build a Basic Loop

Use this weekly loop:

- 3 days of focused practice
- 2 days of ranked/real matches
- 1 day of replay review
- 1 day off

## Step 3: Track Three Metrics

Only track three items:

- win/loss trend
- one mechanical error
- one decision-making error

## Step 4: Improve One Thing at a Time

Do not optimize everything at once.  
Pick one skill each week, then review results at the end of the week.
