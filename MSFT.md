# Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Analysis

Date: January 13, 2025

## Monthly Analysis

![MSFT MONTH](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rfCtNuN1/)

MSFT's monthly trend shows two major phases:
1. Pre-2000 upward trend
2. Post-2009 new trend

The period between 2000-2009 shows a monthly-level oscillation pattern.

Key observation: The adjustment high point after 2021 was 351, while MSFT's current price is only around 410, indicating limited momentum. If the weekly trend ends here, the monthly-level adjustment could be significant, potentially marking the end of the major trend that began in 2009.

## Weekly Analysis

The weekly trend is clear: the trend since 2022 ended in July 2024 (marked in red on the chart).

Currently entering a weekly oscillation range, meaning:
- If a new upward weekly trend forms, the monthly trend continues
- Otherwise, it indicates **monthly trend disruption**

With both weekly and daily charts in large oscillation ranges (three overlapping daily oscillation ranges), there's no immediate reason to expect a daily breakout. We should observe if the daily rebound can save the trend.

Selling after trend failure would be better, but this scenario is unlikely to occur.

## Comparative Analysis with NVDA

### Monthly Comparison

![NVDA Monthly](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUAPODrn/)

Comparing NVDA and MSFT monthly trends, MSFT appears weaker as its monthly trend has turned while NVDA's hasn't.

### Weekly Comparison

![MSFT WEEKLY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pUAPODrn/)

![NVDA WEEKLY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vLMdrndC/)

MSFT's weekly trend has been in an oscillation range since February 2024, confirming the end of the trend that began in December 2022. The key consideration is whether Microsoft can establish a new upward weekly trend, which requires first forming a daily trend.

For MSFT, the appropriate strategy is to trade within the oscillation range and consider adding positions only after a daily trend forms.

For NVDA, we're in the early stages of forming a weekly oscillation pattern. If formed, the target range is 75-89. Since we've already reached the 115 level retracement, the 75-89 range is likely achievable. If a weekly oscillation pattern forms, we can consider NVDA's weekly trend complete.

However, the key difference between NVDA and MSFT is that NVDA has risen 10x from $11 to $120 since late 2022, with a previous peak at $35. If NVDA forms a weekly oscillation pattern ending the previous uptrend, or if it fails to form oscillation and develops a downward trend, the target would be $35.

The main focus is determining whether NVDA will form an oscillation range or a downward trend. For a weekly downward trend to form, a daily downward trend must first develop.

From a downward trend perspective, NVDA's gap is its key difference from MSFT, as it has already formed a daily downward trend and likely a weekly downward trend. Strictly speaking, there's still a slight difference from the weekly trend - if the daily downward trend doesn't fill this gap within the next two weeks, the necessary conditions for a weekly downward trend will be met, though we'll need to observe momentum for sufficient conditions.

![NVDA Daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1k0BBXXU/)

In this context, while MSFT adjusted earlier, its oscillation range is narrower and more defined, indicating it has already formed a weekly oscillation pattern. We only need to observe whether this weekly oscillation will lead to a new upward trend or a downward trend.
