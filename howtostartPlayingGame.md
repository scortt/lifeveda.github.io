# How to Start Playing Game

I’d like to share my journey from being an ordinary gamer to exploring the vast world of video games, offering insights for those new to gaming.

As someone who identifies as a seasoned gamer—seasoned to the point where, at the age of 35, I realized I had missed out on many iconic titles like Dark Souls—I consider myself an experienced yet traditional gamer. My perspective began to shift with the birth of my son in 2016, prompting me to think about how I could share the joy of gaming with him. This led me to contemplate how I would discuss video games with him, his teachers, and others, sparking my interest in a broader range of video games than I had previously explored.

This exploration revealed that I was capable of, and even excelled at, a wider array of games than I had initially thought. This realization opened my eyes to the growth, enjoyment, and bonding experiences video games can provide. My aim became to introduce gaming to those unfamiliar with it, hoping to share the joy and benefits I discovered.

Thus, I began to share my experiences with friends and family, many of whom suggested I write articles to guide newcomers into the gaming world. This idea blossomed into a plan, and thus, this blog was born. While gaming is a primary focus, this site will also feature articles on a variety of topics, including investment advice, math learning techniques, and culinary creations.

Before I begin, I’ll share my experience: everyone can play difficult video games like Dark Souls, really, everyone can. Before I played Dark Souls, I thought I couldn’t handle such difficult video games, but that’s not true. Everyone can play difficult video games as long as the game is good enough.

However, where might I discover games that are truly worth playing? Is there an equivalent to IMDb for video games?

Yes, we do. https://www.metacritic.com is the best website for video game scores. In the following articles, I will teach you how to use Metacritic.
