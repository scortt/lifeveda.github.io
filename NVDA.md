# NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Analysis

- Date: 2025-01-28

## Monthly Analysis

![NVDA Monthly Report](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rFFibzrg/)

- From a monthly perspective, NVDA's history since listing can be divided into two parts:
  1. From listing to November 2012: A period of monthly oscillation
  2. From November 2012 to 2024: A period of monthly upward trend
- Looking at the monthly oscillation range, NVDA's current target oscillation level is at the December 2021 high of 34. While this seems unlikely from a fundamental perspective (which would imply a PE ratio of only 15), the technical indicators suggest this possibility.

## Weekly Analysis

- From a weekly perspective, since June 2024, NVDA has entered a complex oscillation range, which became even more complex when a sub-weekly trend began in August 2024.
- Current market conditions suggest that if the weekly chart cannot return to normal oscillation range in the short term, it may form a downward trend.
- If a weekly downward trend forms, even if the monthly upward trend remains, it would be an adjustment trend towards 34, presenting a significant opportunity for NVDA.

## Daily Analysis

- The daily chart shows a simpler pattern: a small daily upward trend ended in November 2024, followed by daily-level oscillation, and now a downward breakout.

This analysis could be particularly significant as it might indicate the end of the overall NASDAQ trend, which would require further complex analysis.
